# MCU Design
  The Microcontroller talks to the Wii Nunchuck through I2C. Through two lines, Serial Clock and Serial Data, the microcontroller is able to recognize itself as the controller and the nunchuck as the receiver. The Microcontroller first sends out a start condition that flags the start of a communication request. Then, an address is sent out along with the type of request (read/write) and the MCU waits for an acknowledgement from the Nunchuk. After that, an initialization process needs to be completed by sending over 2 sets of 2 data bytes that allow the Nunchuckâ€™s first and second registers to be used. Then, the sensor data on the Nunchuk can be read at any time by first sending the address and a handshake byte and then sending the address again along with the request and any relevant data bytes. For a read, the Nunchuck will send over its bytes of information to the Microcontroller. The data comes in the form of 6 bytes of data corresponding to the position of the joystick, the state of two buttons, the rotation of the controller, and the acceleration of the controller. When the write or read is complete, a stop condition is enforced, allowing the MCU to exit controller mode and wait for a communication to be requested again. Figure 1 contains a block diagram of the whole system.

  Once the Nunchuck message is received, it is parsed to pull out the x and y positions of the joystick and the states of the two buttons on the controller. Once these inputs are decoded, the MCU translates them into player movements and/or menu interactions and updates the game state as well as the screen that will be displayed on the LED Matrix. The display data is sent to the FPGA over SPI according to the communication standard defined in the FGPA design section. The MCU then waits for the DONE signal from the FPGA, signaling that the FPGA is done shifting data into the display and that the MCU can send over the next message.


# FPGA Design
  The LED matrix uses its own custom SPI-like communication protocol, shown in Figure 2. The matrix has four pins: CLK, CS, WR, and DATA. The DATA and WR pins act like the SDI and SCL pins from SPI, where data is written serially over DATA on the rising edge of WR to the matrix's internal memory. The CLK and CS pins require a bit more explanation. The matrix contains four HT1632C LED driver chips, each of which controls a fourth of the display. Displaying an image on the matrix involves writing the proper bits to each of the four chips, and the CLK and CS pins allows one to select which chip to write to. CLK and CS are wired to the CP and DSA pins of a 74HC164 shift register, and the chip select pins of the four HT1632C chips are wired to the Q0, Q1, Q2, and Q3 pins.

  The purpose of the FPGA is to receive a message over SPI from the MCU written using the communication standard defined earlier in this report, and to translate that SPI message into one following this custom protocol, which includes the proper bits, timing, and chip multiplexing. The digital circuit design, shown in Figure 4, follows the architecture of a processor, with a single controller managing the rest of the subcircuits through control signals. The state transition diagram for the controller is shown in Figure 3.

# MCU-to-FPGA Communication Standard

Communication between the MCU and FPGA occurs through 16-bit SPI transactions. The ID bit contains the operation type. The purpose of the remaining bits varies depending on whether the operation is a write or a command.

| ID            | Instruction   |
| :-----------: |:-------------:|

Table 1. Instructions corresponding to the ID bit

Write messages consist of position bits X[4:0] and Y[1:0], green LED control bits G[3:0], and red LED control bits R[3:0].

</p>

As shown in Figure 5, the display is split into columns of four LEDs, where each LED in the column can be independently controlled. The write operation is used to control the LEDs in one of these columns, either by toggling them on/off, or by changing their color. The position bits X[4:0] and Y[1:0] define the (x, y) location of this column, defining (0, 0) to be at the top left of the display. The color bits R[3:0] and G[3:0] toggle the red and green LEDs respectively on each column. 

**X[4:0]: Control Location X**  
These bits are used to define the x-coordinate location of the column to be controlled, defining x = 0 as the left edge of the display.

**Y[1:0]: Control Location Y**  
These bits are used to define the y-coordinate location of the column to be controlled, defining y = 0 as the top edge of the display.

**G[3:0]: Green LED Enable**  
These bits individually toggle the four green LEDs within each column.  
0: LED off  
1: LED on  

**R[3:0]: Red LED Enable**  
These bits individually toggle the four red LEDs within each column.  
0: LED off  
1: LED on

Figure 5. The display is split into columns of four LEDs. The four LEDs in a column can be controlled with a single write operation on that column.

The command operation is used to control system-level functionalities of the display. The command code bits CC[14:0] define the target functionality. Table 1 lists relevant command codes. Other command codes are listed in the HT1632C datasheet.
